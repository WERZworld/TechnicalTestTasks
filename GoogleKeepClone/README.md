## Requirements

### Stack

Use React for front-end and Firebase for authentication and real-time database.

### Front-end (client)

- **Web** Use latest version of React and `create-react-app` to bootstrap the project.
- **Mobile** Use at least React Native v.0.60
- We suggest to use a UI framework with no custom styles. Use [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) (more preferable) or [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) (less preferable).
- **Bonus** Use TypeScript
- **Bonus** Use Hooks


### Back-end

- Use Firebase for authentication
- Use Firebase for data storage
- **Bonus** Use Firebase Cloud Functions for when necessary

## How to proceed with the test task

1. Complete a technical test task;
2. Commit your code into a **private** GitHub repository
3. Invite roman.tsegelskyi@kalon.tech and andriy.tsaryov@kalon.tech as collaborators to that repository.

## Must-haves

- All the code must be checked by [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) or [xo](https://github.com/xojs/xo).
- Use Git for version control and split your work into meaningful commits.
- Both apps must be deployed so that everyone can check it out. You can use [Now](https://zeit.co/now).
- Configuration and security credentials should not be stored in the code.
