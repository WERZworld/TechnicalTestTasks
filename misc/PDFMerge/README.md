[MergeExample](example.png)

### Basic requirements

- The pdf pages should not be converted into images (the text from the original pdfs should still be selectable in the merged pdf);
- Written in NodeJS
- Follows common conventions for UNIX command line tools
- Documentation on how to run the tool

### Extended requirements

- Handles well corrupted PDF files
- Can be installed as NPM package
- Uses TypeScript
- Has UnitTest

## How to proceed with the test task

1. Complete a technical test task;
2. Commit your code into a **private** GitHub repository
3. Invite roman.tsegelskyi@kalon.tech and andriy.tsaryov@kalon.tech as collaborators to that repository.

## Must-haves

- All the code must be checked by [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) or [xo](https://github.com/xojs/xo).
- Use Git for version control and split your work into meaningful commits.
- Both apps must be deployed so that everyone can check it out. You can use [Now](https://zeit.co/now).
- Configuration and security credentials should not be stored in the code.
